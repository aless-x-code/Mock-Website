      <h1>A place to improve AI technology, together.</h1>
      <p>AI Test Kitchen is an app where people can experience and give feedback on some of Google’s latest AI technologies. Our goal is to learn, improve, and innovate responsibly on AI together. 
        <br id="item-1-line-break"></br>
      We’ll be opening up to small groups of people gradually. Stay tuned for more updates.</p>

      <h2>What are generative language models?</h2>
      <p>Generative language models are able to produce text about anything. They do this by recognizing patterns in language and predicting what comes next. This is how our model <a href="">LaMDA</a> (Language Model for Dialog Applications) is able to converse on any topic and respond to anything you ask it.</p>
    </div>
    <div> <!--2nd-->
      <h2>What are the challenges?</h2>
      <p>The ability of these models to generate infinite possibilities shows potential, but it also means they don’t always get things quite right. And while we’ve made substantial improvements in safety and accuracy in the latest version of LaMDA, we’re still at the beginning of a journey.</p>
    </div>
    <div> <!--3rd-->
      <h2>How do we make progress together?</h2>
      <p>One important part of developing responsibly is expanding participation, so more people can experience LaMDA and provide feedback. They give you a sense of what it might be like to have LaMDA in your hands, and use it for things you care about - creativity, planning, learning, and more. Each demo invites you to give feedback to help make language models safer and more accurate together.</p>

      <h3>Imagine It</h3> <!--big title-->
      <h4>What you can do</h4> <!--smaller title-->
      <p>Name a place and LaMDA will offer paths to explore your imagination.</p>
      <h4>What you can give feedback on:</h4> <!--smaller title-->
      <p>If LaMDA generates interesting scene descriptions that are relevant to your idea.</p>

    <div> <!-- 2nd demo-->
      <h3>List It</h3> <!--big title-->
      <h4>What you can do</h4> <!--smaller title-->
      <p>Name a goal or topic and see how much LaMDA can break it down into multiple lists of subtasks.</p>
      <h4>What you can give feedback on:</h4> <!--smaller title-->
      <p>If LaMDA generates useful lists of subtasks, some of which you might not have thought of.</p>

      <h3>Talk About It (Dogs Edition)</h3> <!--big title-->
      <h4>What you can do</h4> <!--smaller title-->
      <p>Roll with the conversation and see where it goes. It’s just a fun, kinda-weird, open-ended chat.</p>
      <h4>What you can give feedback on:</h4> <!--smaller title-->
      <p>If LaMDA, no matter what you ask it, keeps the conversation going while bringing the topic back to dogs.</p>
